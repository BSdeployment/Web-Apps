# My Web Applications Repository

This repository contains a diverse collection of web applications built using various technologies and frameworks, all within the main directory of this repository. You'll find projects implemented with:

* **ASP.NET Core (.NET)**
* **Python (various frameworks, e.g., Flask, Django)**
* **Node.js (e.g., Express.js)**
* **Angular**
* **React**
* **And potentially other technologies**

## About These Applications

The web applications included in this repository are primarily intended for **learning and demonstration purposes**. They showcase different approaches to web development, highlighting the syntax, features, and best practices associated with each technology. By exploring these projects, you can gain valuable insights into:

* **Full-stack development concepts**
* **Backend development using different languages and frameworks**
* **Frontend development with popular JavaScript frameworks**
* **Integration between frontend and backend components**
* **Different architectural patterns and design choices**

Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced developer wanting to explore new stacks, these applications can serve as practical examples and starting points for your own projects.

## Getting Started

To run each application, please refer to the specific README file (if available) or the main files of each project. Instructions on prerequisites, installation, and running the application will typically be found within the project's core files or a dedicated README. Look for files like `requirements.txt` (for Python), `package.json` (for Node.js, Angular, React), project files (`.csproj` for .NET), etc.

## Technologies Used

This repository demonstrates my experience with a wide array of web development technologies, including but not limited to:

* **Backend Frameworks/Languages:** .NET (C#), Python, Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)
* **Frontend Frameworks/Libraries:** Angular, React
* **Potentially other databases, tools, and libraries**
