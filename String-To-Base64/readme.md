# String to Base64 Converter Web App

This project is a simple web application that converts strings to Base64 and decodes Base64 back to strings.  
The app is built with a **Next.js** frontend and an **ASP.NET Core Web API** backend. 

## Features

- **String to Base64**: Encode any string into Base64 format.
- **Base64 to String**: Decode Base64 strings back to their original format.
- **Modern Web Technologies**:
  - **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  - **Backend**: Powered by ASP.NET Core Web API for efficient and robust encoding/decoding logic.

## How It Works

1. Users input a string or Base64 data into the frontend interface.
2. The Next.js frontend communicates with the ASP.NET Core Web API backend via HTTP requests.
3. The backend processes the request, performing the conversion between string and Base64, and sends the result back to the frontend.

## Prerequisites

- **Frontend**: 
  - Node.js
  - NPM or Yarn
- **Backend**:
  - .NET SDK (8.0 or later)
