**Project: Authentication and Authorization using JWT in.NET Core**
===========================================================

### Overview

*   **Backend:** ASP Core Web API
*   **Frontend:** Blazor App
*   **Security Framework:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Operating System:**.NET Core

### Goals

*   To demonstrate the implementation of authentication and authorization in a.NET Core Web API
*   To showcase the use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization
*   To provide a basic structure for running the project

### Project Structure

```
Project
|____ AuthenticationApi (ASP Core Web API)
|       |____ Controllers
|       |____ Models
|       |____ Services
|       |____ Startup.cs
|____ AuthBlazorApp (Blazor App)
|       |____ Pages
|       |____ Shared
|       |____ App.razor
|____ Test
|       |____ TestCase.csproj
|____.gitignore
|____ README.md
```

### Authentication Flow

1.  **Registration:** User registers with the system, providing credentials (username, password, email).
2.  **Login:** User logs in with their credentials, which are verified against the database.
3.  **Token Generation:** If credentials are correct, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client.
4.  **Token Validation:** On subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT token in the Authorization header.
5.  **Authorization:** The server validates the token and grants access to protected resources.

### Authorization Flow

1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles and assign permissions to each role.
2.  **Privilege-Based Access Control (PBAC):** Assign privileges to users based on their roles.
3.  **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC):** Define policies based on user roles, permissions, and privileges.

### Quick Start

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-jwt-net-core.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `dotnet restore`
3.  Run the API: `dotnet run`
4.  Open the Blazor App: `dotnet run --project AuthBlazorApp`
5.  Register and login to access protected resources

### Note

This is a basic implementation of authentication and authorization using JWT in.NET Core. You should adapt it to your specific use case and security requirements.
